Support\n","2. lift\n","3. confidence\n","\n","**Support**\n","Support(item)=Transactions comprising the item/Total transactions\n","\n","\n","A high support value indicates that the item is present in most purchases,therefore markets should focus on it more.\n","\n","**Confidence**\n","It tells us about the likelohood of different purchases combinations. we calculate that using the following formula:\n","Confidence(Bread->Milk)= Transactions comprising bread and milk / Transactions comprising bread\n","**Lift**\n","Finally Lift refers to the increase in the ratio of the sale of milk when you sell bread:\n","Lift= Confidence(Bread -> Milk)/Support(Bread)=0.75/1=1.3.\n","This Means that customers are 1.3 times more likely to buy milk if u also sell bread."],"metadata":{"id":"WghZksIUOOtS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Step 1: Pre-requisites for performing Market Basket Analysis**\n","\n","Download the dataset
